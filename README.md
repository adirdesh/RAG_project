# RAG_project

The most interesting problem I have recently worked on was creating a secure, multi-organization Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable enterprises to query their Google Drive documents without crossing access boundaries. I implemented a full pipeline involving document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, FAISS based indexing and a FastAPI backend with OpenAI/Groq models for response generation. The most difficult part was implementing role-­‐based access control and data isolation at the organization level which I solved by creating a FAISS index per organization and separate metadata layers across all organizations. I then included the authentication with AWS Cognito so that every query is first authenticated using JWTs before accessing any index or document. To make the system usable, I made a Streamlit frontend that serves up a slick chat interface with real-time responses. I fully documented the architecture, how to set this up and also design decisions in the project’s GitHub repository so that others can try out and build further on top of the system.
